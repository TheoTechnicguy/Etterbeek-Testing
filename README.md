## Notes on pre-0.2.0 `CovRecord.py` versions.
The pre-0.2.0 era of CovRecord was in a private repository (because of built-in login data) :angel:. At the 0.2.0 version commit, all identifiable authentication have been redacted. It is possible to get a pre-0.2.0 version, you just need to send me an email and I will see what I can do.
